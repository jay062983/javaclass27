Collections Framework;

A collection of classes and interfaces which help us store and manage
objects in the form of collections.
for example
ArrayList  and linkedList
these classes make it easier to manage data as they have in built methods.

Wrapper classes:
we can use primitive data types as objects with help of wrapper classes.
primitive data types are not supported by the classes in collections framework.

Boxing:
is the process of converting primitive data types to its corresponding wrapper type or object type.
AutoBoxing:
says just assign a wrapper type to a primitive type variable and the conversion will happen automatically

ex:
Integer i= new Integer (10)   => Boxing
int one = i; =>unboxing

AutoBoxing:
Character ch='a';

ArrayList:
ArrayList is a part of collections framework. we can store single objects inside arrayList

Dimond operator:
Dimond operator also called angle brackets ""<>""
They are used to specify the name of the class whose objects we will be storing inside the classes
